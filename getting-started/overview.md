# Overview

Emporium is a user-friendly, self-hosted platform that lets you deploy pre-configured apps and services in a snap. No need for tough manual setups - Emporium handles this for you.

With its built-in automatic authentication, even applications lacking their own won't be exposed to the public internet.

Plus, since you're hosting these tools yourself, you're in charge of your own data.
